This document tracks how this thesis has evolved based on accumulating signals.
Each entry links to the signals that drove the change.

## v2.0 - 2026-01-12

**Major** | Currency markets validate universal industrial policy adoption

Added new section "Currency Markets Tell the Real Story" based on Russell Clark's analysis showing traditional FX relationships have collapsed. This provides market-based evidence (not just policy analysis) that every major economy is being forced into industrial policy and fiscal expansion.

Key insight: When currency traders stop differentiating between economies based on traditional fundamentals, they're pricing in that all will pursue the same policy path. Only Swiss Franc maintains safe-haven status. Precious metals surge as the only "currency" outside government control.

This strengthens the thesis framing: reshoring isn't just US policy—it's a global phenomenon where the old rules no longer apply.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Currency relationships collapse as industrial policy becomes universal (Russell Clark)
- Trade shifted from China to Vietnam/Mexico, not back to US (evolving)
- Kearny Reshore Index falls 300+ basis points (challenging—but consistent with implementation difficulty, not thesis failure)
- Manufacturing labor shortage: 500K jobs unfilled (challenging—constrains pace, not direction)

**Signal Balance Update:** +1 supporting, +4 challenging, +1 evolving

## v1.8 - 2024-12-21

**Refinement** | Professional services demand quantified

Updated to include $40B+ professional services demand estimate as reshoring creates derivative opportunities beyond manufacturing itself.

**Triggering Signals:**
- BCG reshoring advisory practice growth
- Big 4 supply chain practice expansions
- GovCon reshoring-related RFPs increasing

---

## v1.5 - 2024-09-15

**Minor** | Supply chain resilience overtakes cost

Adjusted framing from "cost doesn't matter" to "resilience matters more." The calculus shifted after continued semiconductor supply disruptions and auto industry lessons.

> Labor costs matter less than supply chain resilience in the new calculus.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Auto OEM reshoring announcements
- Semiconductor fab construction timelines
- Insurance pricing for supply chain risk

## v1.3 - 2024-07-20

**Refinement** | Bipartisan policy consensus solidifies

Updated to reflect that reshoring has become rare bipartisan agreement. CHIPS Act implementation, IRA manufacturing incentives, and continued tariff policies across administrations.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Biden administration CHIPS Act funding
- Continued Trump-era tariff policies
- State-level manufacturing incentive competition

## v1.0 - 2024-06-15

**Major** | Initial thesis formulation

Original hypothesis: 30% of China-dependent supply chains will have US alternatives by 2028, driven by pandemic awareness transforming into policy consensus.

**Triggering Signals:**
- Initial research and observations
- Pandemic supply chain disruptions
- US-China decoupling acceleration
