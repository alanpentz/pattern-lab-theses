# AI & Knowledge Work

## The Core Argument

Professional services firms are facing an inflection point that most don't recognize yet. The same forces that automated manufacturing in the 1980s are now coming for knowledge work—but faster, and with different winners and losers.

> **Key Claim:** Within 36 months, the unit economics of expertise delivery will invert. Firms that previously competed on senior talent density will compete on AI leverage ratios.

This isn't about chatbots handling customer service. It's about the fundamental restructuring of how professional knowledge gets created, validated, and delivered. The accounting firm that took 40 hours to prepare a complex return will do it in 4. The law firm that needed a team for due diligence will need one person with the right tools.

## Who Moves First?

Large enterprises will adopt AI slowly—procurement cycles, compliance requirements, change management overhead. But smaller, more agile firms have both the pain and the capacity to move fast.

The firms that transform first share common traits: established client relationships, owners who feel margin pressure personally, and small enough teams that one or two people can drive change without committee approval.

> "The best time to adopt AI was a year ago. The second best time is before your competitors do."

## The Connection to Reshoring

As manufacturing returns to the US, a new category of professional services demand emerges. Companies need accounting, legal, HR, and consulting services that understand domestic manufacturing contexts. This creates opportunity for AI-augmented firms that can scale expertise across this new client base.

> **Key Claim:** The reshoring wave will generate $40B+ in new professional services demand over the next decade. AI-native firms will capture disproportionate share.

## What I'm Watching

Three signals I'm tracking to validate or invalidate this thesis:

**1. AI tool adoption curves** — Are professional services firms adopting AI tools faster than the base rate of enterprise software? Early data says yes.

**2. Pricing pressure** — Are clients starting to expect AI-speed delivery at AI-era prices? Not yet, but the conversation is starting.

**3. Talent market shifts** — Are "AI-native" professionals commanding premiums, or is AI fluency becoming table stakes? The former, for now.

## Implications for Owners

If this thesis holds, the strategic implications for SMB professional services owners are significant:

1. **Invest in AI infrastructure now** — The learning curve is your moat
2. **Rethink pricing models** — Value-based pricing becomes more defensible
3. **Focus on client relationships** — AI handles the work, humans handle the trust
4. **Prepare for consolidation** — AI-native firms will acquire laggards
