# Reshoring & Deglobalization

## The Core Argument

The 40-year experiment in global supply chain optimization is ending. What started as pandemic-driven awareness has become bipartisan policy consensus: critical manufacturing must come home.

This isn't protectionism dressed up in new language. It's a fundamental repricing of risk. The calculus that made it "efficient" to source from the lowest-cost producer assumed stable geopolitics, reliable shipping, and abundant energy. None of those assumptions hold anymore.

> **Key Claim:** 30% of China-dependent supply chains will have US or allied-nation alternatives by 2028.

## Currency Markets Tell the Real Story

Traditional FX relationships have collapsed—and this tells us something profound about what's coming.

Russell Clark's analysis reveals that currency pairs that moved predictably for decades have flatlined:

- **KRW/JPY**: Used to reset regularly due to Korean inflation differentials. Flat since 2015.
- **AUD/Gold**: Australia is a major gold producer, but the correlation is gone.
- **CAD/MXN**: Both commodity-heavy US trading partners—historically, Canada outperformed. Now flat for 10 years.
- **Yen weakness**: Persists despite rising JGB yields and narrowing US-Japan rate differentials.

**The only relationship that still holds: Swiss Franc appreciates during uncertainty.**

What does this mean? Currency traders are pricing in that *every* major economy will pursue fiscal expansion and industrial policy. The US chose this path. Japan chose it. Korea is being forced into it (tariffs + reduced military umbrella). The market now assumes Canada will follow Mexico into the industrial policy camp.

> **New Key Claim:** Currency markets signal every major economy is adopting industrial policy—making precious metals the only "currency" not subject to deliberate debasement.

## Why Now?

Three forces converging simultaneously:

**1. Geopolitical reality** — The US-China relationship has fundamentally shifted. Taiwan risk alone is forcing companies to rethink semiconductor dependencies.

**2. Policy support** — CHIPS Act, IRA, and bipartisan reshoring incentives create financial tailwinds for domestic production.

**3. Automation economics** — Robotics and AI narrow the labor cost gap. When labor is 10% of cost instead of 40%, proximity to customers matters more.

## What This Means for Investors

The obvious plays (construction, industrial automation) are already priced. The second-order effects are not:

- **Professional services demand** — New factories need accountants, lawyers, HR consultants who understand manufacturing
- **Regional banking** — Manufacturing belt banks will finance the buildout
- **Workforce housing** — Factory towns need homes, and workers need services
- **Energy infrastructure** — Manufacturing is energy-intensive; grid buildout follows

## What I'm Watching

**1. Factory announcement velocity** — Are new announcements accelerating or plateauing?

**2. Supply chain cost data** — Is domestic production actually more expensive, or is the gap narrowing?

**3. Skilled labor constraints** — Are workforce bottlenecks slowing the buildout?

## The Connection to Other Theses

Reshoring intersects with nearly every other thesis I track:

- **Inflation** — Domestic production costs more in the short term, contributing to structural inflation
- **AI & Knowledge Work** — Professional services demand from reshoring benefits AI-native firms
- **Demographics** — Aging workforce constrains manufacturing labor availability
