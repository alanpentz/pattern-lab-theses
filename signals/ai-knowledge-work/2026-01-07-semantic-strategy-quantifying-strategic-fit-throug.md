# Semantic Strategy: Quantifying Strategic Fit Through Capability Encoding

## Signal

Developed and demonstrated a methodology for strategic planning that treats company capabilities as vectors in a semantic space.

**Core innovation:** Instead of qualitative strategy discussions, encode capabilities as scored dimensions (0-1), define strategies as required capability profiles, and calculate mathematical fit.

**Demonstrated on Meta:**
- Encoded Meta and competitors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 12 dimensions
- Meta's best-fit strategy: Open Ecosystem Play (98% fit)
- Meta's actual moves (Manus acquisition, closed-source Avocado): Agent-First (89% fit)
- Key finding: Strategic clarity gap (35% vs 77% competitor avg) is Meta's deepest problem

**Key insight:** Companies with unique assets often waste them competing in games where others have structural advantages. The methodology reveals these mismatches mathematically.

Built Phase 1 implementation: Supabase schema, Python encoder module, Claude Code skill.

## Analysis

Novel methodology that combines vector-based encoding with strategic planning. Concrete example of AI enabling new analytical approaches to knowledge work.
